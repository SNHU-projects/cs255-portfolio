This repo is a portfolio for my CS 255 course on Modern System Analysis &amp; Design

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The main project work throughout the course was DriverPass. DriverPass sought to address the issue of subpar driving education. According to their research, more than 65% of people fail their driving tests at the DMV. The purpose of this project was to provide better driver training through online courses and live instruction.

## What did you do particularly well?
Thanks to this course, I have a much better handle on analyzing systems and representing abstract concepts visually. The diagrams I created to demonstrate classes, activities, sequences and data flow actually provided a lot of clarity for me and I think I did them well.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to improve my UML class diagram. In terms of the methods I documented, there is certainly room for improvement. Accessor methods were easy to capture, but the interrelated nature of the classes requires more thought and a deeper understanding of how these objects will be leveraged to meet the needs of the system’s users. Adding additional methods that covers these ideas would be beneficial.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Consideration of user needs guided my approach to system design from the start. I crafted diagrams that reflected likely user interactions. With respect to the class diagram, I played off the sequence and activity diagrams to anticipate how each class would utilized. Without careful thought around user needs, the system design may remain too abstract to yield any practical solutions to the problems it’s intended to solve.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
One of the most important lessons I learned from this course is an iterative design approach. Using this method, I worry less about capturing all the details initially, which used to bog my speed down. I use repetitive passes over a project with each subsequent turn providing deeper insight and including more details than the last. I will continue to hone this technique in future projects.
